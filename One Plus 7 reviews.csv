0,Shahzeb,5,Upgraded Beast In Old Package With Everything +Quality [ Personal Review After Using It For 20 Days],"I will divide my review in four sections first my personal experience which i wanna mention separately after that Pros and Cons which i found and lastly how it fairs with the competition.[AND ALSO THE IMAGES SHARED IN THE REVIEW ARE CLICKED IN STOCK CAMERA WITHOUT ANY POST EDITING].1. MY PERSONAL VIEWS/EXPERIENCE:>> I have given 4 star rating , i wanted to give 4.5 start but there wasn't any option such. Now why i am cutting 1 or 1/2 star its because the unit i received didn't had the plastic frame properly fitted which is between display and the aluminium frame. I tried to do a replacement through amazon app but there wasn't any proper option for it i even called amazon care but was kept in queue for hours then i didn't had much time to waste in them i decided to keep this same device with the fear of getting dust inside the front camera and display through that unplaced frame.This is just because of lack of good quality control. I think OnePlus should take care of quality check as per the good reputation they have got. And Amazon should have smooth policies for their customers who face such issues.2. PROS:>>Camera: The camera is great has ois clicks very good images in low light as well as in daylight. Good for recording videos too.>>Fingerprint Reader: The in-display fingerprint reader is way faster than the predecessor. I can bet i got frustrated while using it on Oneplus 6T but its not the case with Oneplus 7 you will feel the satisfaction of speed and accuracy while using the FP on this device.>>Battery Life: The battery is very good enough i am getting 8 hours around SOT on mixed usage, 9 hours SOT on low usage and 7 hours of SOT on heavy usage.*My mixed usage is watching YouTube,clicking some photos, using Twitter, Instagram, Sanpchat, Telegram, playing PUBG for 1-2 hours, listening to music.*My light usage includes surfing twitter, instagram, telegram, some youtube videos, normal calls, clicking photos, 10-15 mins of gaming.*My heavy usage consists of 3-4 hours of gaming 2-3 hours of YouTube, using camera lot and surfing little bit of social media.>>Display and Stereo Speakers: The display is amoled the blacks look real and deep. The stereo speakers are a very good upgrade from previous OnePlus devices but the front speaker could have been more loud.>>UFS 3.0: The device comes with UFS 3.0 which i guess is the only device other than OnePlus 7 Pro . This makes a huge difference when comparing to other devices the read/write operations and other app openings and processing is way more faster than other devices.>>Software: You can't ever go wrong with Oxygen Os which comes in OnePlus devices. It's the most stable and faster software experience you will find out there. It contains few Additional features to enhance the user experience and still keeps itself more to stock android. We can't deny its even better than Googles on software on pixel devices.>> Pricing: I can say the pricing of the OnePlus 7 is very good they even reduced the pricing from their last release. With this price OnePlus have booked their spot in Overall Good Package With Quality At Reasonable Price.3. CONS:>>Design and Display: Though internals of the Oneplus 7 are latest but the design is still almost similar to Oneplus 6t except the camera bump. They could have done something with water drop display. Though its amoled its look old in 2019 with that notch.>> Speakers: The stereo speakers are good but could have been more loud. The voice feels little low.>>Camera: The camera clicks unnatural images different from reality and even lacks details. I am not saying the camera is bad its already good the images looks pleasant in eyes. But they aren't real. I guess they can fix the processing of images clicked and enhance the photography experience through software updates. Also it would have been better if OnePlus had included a wide angle lens instead of the depth sensor.>> 3.5mm Headphone Jack: One of the most important thing ignored by the OnePlus from previous generation and also in this generation is the Headphone Jack. The convenience to listen to music or watch videos, etc directly by putting the headphones in the headphone jack is far better than using Bluetooth on device, charging Bluetooth Headphones Charging them again sometimes in between your music or entertainment. Oneplus is ignoring this purposely we can see devices with 5000 Mah battery having headphone jack. Just to increase battery to 3700 mah they had to remove headphone jack is a silly excuse.>>No USB Type C to 3.5mm Converter in the box this times means the user has to buy 400 INR converter if he needs to use wired headphones.[My views on the company which already got its own market and users]:I feel like OnePlus is focusing more on the Oneplus 7 Pro and Getting Profit out of everything skipping heaphone jack(selling oneplus bullets), using old design, using old display design, skipping wide angle (only cause the Oneplus7 pro audience don't get there eyes on much affordable and value flagship Oneplus 7). But still buyers including me are attracted and buy OnePlus for the quality and software experience they provide at good price.4. OnePlus 7 Vs Asus 6z Vs Redmi K20 Pro:The strong competitors to Oneplus 7 are Asus 6z and Redmi K20 Pro. Both comes with notchelss displays but Asus 6z uses IPS LCD and and Redmi K20 Pro which has Amoled but thats not upto the mark. So you get good quality display with Oneplus 7 with that notch that shouldn't be a big issue. If you like notchless display you can settle with IPS LCD on Asus 6z or Low Quality Redmi K20 Pros Amoled else settle with notch on good Amoled of OnePlus 7. It all depends on your needs.The camera between this 3 devices is tough to compare the oneplus 7 takes good portraits and low light images thanks to the dept sensor and OIS the lack of wideangle lens gives edge to Asus 6z but OnePlus 7 covers it with OIS and good low light performance. While the asus 6z has good image quality colors looks good in images shot with low light and the rear camera is the selfie camera which is big advantage if you use your front camera more and a good decent wide angle camera which helps in many scenarios but it struggles in low light it has good implementation of eis in video recording. While Redmi K20 Pro comes with triple rear camera a wide angle and also telephoto lens it performs very well in day light but struggles in low light also it doesn't have ois and eis is not that well implemented.Asus 6z has serious in call sound issue as i heard from many users. The volume from in call speaker is very low. Its an issue till Asus fixes it.Redmi k20 pro inspite having thermal cooling technology throttles on heavy task like repeated use of benchmarking apps while oneplus 7 doesn't hold itself back and performs consistently.Me personally feels like OnePlus 7 is the Perfect device between this three phones followed by Asus 6z who is making new innovations and also making there software experience better as per the users suggestions and also keeping up with quality. My only reason to give Redmi K20 Pro third position is not that great front camera, throttling on heavy usage, display quality is okayish and god knows what else cost cutting they did this time. I would only have one opinion for people interested Redmi Flagships Stay Away from them they Lack Quality. There are way better options like OnePlus and Asus who care for quality and delivers. Mi series flagships are better but they aren't released in India sadly.I will recommend Oneplus 7 to people who are looking for a good value flagship which has quality and also delivers the performance it promises. The OnePlus 7 is more value to price we pay compared to the Oneplus 7 Pro.PS: The users saying in the review section that the second speaker grill on the bottom isn't working.I need to tell them that on bottom  there is only one speaker other speaker grill is just for the design. The second speaker is rear mounted in-call speaker."
1,Alfa Xavier,5,Fastest Android device till date!!!,"Pros: 1) Best processor - Lightning quick performance. Even beats OP 7Pro on benchmarks and speed due to the smaller display and smaller resolution.2) Fingerprint scanner and face unlock is fast as flash.3) Dash Charging is almost equal to the warp charger because of the charging speed after 50%.4) Screen On Time - 7 hrs for a typical use without adaptive battery settings on.5) Amazing display and amazing in hand feel.6) Camera is good but not up to the I phone or pixel level, but it's not a hardware issue, as this phone has the Sony IMX 586 sensors, it perform magically on Google Camera. So just matter of updates which will bring the camera level to top. Recently OP pro received the 9.5.7 camera update and it improves the camera to the level of the other flagships. So hopefully this will receive that update too.7) Oxygen OS 9.5.4 with Android Pie is smooth and better compared to stock Android though it retains the skin and features of stock OS.8) Not a tinge of heating at all. I can't remember a time when I had to flip the phone or feel a warmth on the body.9) Built quality is premium.10) I'm not a pop up camera fan. So I'm happy that I'm getting a tear drop notch instead. Saves a few battery for face unlock without the motorized cam.11) Stereo speakers is loud and clear. Sound quality with Dolby Atmos is lit.12) Call quality and noise cancellation is premium.13) Nightscape 2.O beats Google's Night Sight, in extreme dark conditions. So night photography is one of the best. Though Google pulls out in moderate lightning where it gives more natural edges and corners in the picture.14) No ads like Xiomi or other brands. The OS is premium and butter smooth. There are no bloatwares.15) One of the best device for gaming with gaming mode, best GPU, and added modes like fanatic mode.16) One Plus doesn't spend more on IP certification. This doesn't mean that the phone fails. Have any doubt, please check out the YouTube videos from multiple sources and you'll get to know that the device can withstand in water for long.17) Corning Gorilla Glass 6 on front, and Corning Gorilla Glass 5 at the back though the glass back can attract fingerprints. So recommend that you use the case provided which is decent.18) Gestures on Oxygen OS is heaven. Using navigation gestures can give you a full screen experience apart from the notch.19) One Plus is quite quick in updates. I received my first update on the receiving day itself.20) Optic AMOLED display is top quality. You'll not feel putting the phone down. ♥️21) Slow motion in 1080p at 240fps is available.22) The pricing of the phone is fair, and it's the best value for money if you can sacrifice a bit more storage or ram at 33k.23) Haptic feedback is top quality but not best compared to OP7Pro24) The delivery from Amazon was super fast. I got it delivered free in 48 hrs.Cons: 1) One Plus don't provide 3.5mm headphone jack anymore. But neither does it provide a USB 3.1 dongle or headphones in box.2) Camera bump is protruding, so you'll have to use the case that is provided to eliminate this issue.3) Stock Camera app needs to get proper updates to utilize the hardware to its maximum capacity. Hopefully in coming months if not days.4) Matte finish model is not available for 7 though it's available for 7Pro.5) If you love red color, you're not getting it for 33k. It's only available for 38k.6) The pre applied protector is quality one, but it is not a tempered glass. So you'll have to spend and extra 1000 to get the one plus designed tempered glass.7) The provided silicon case is premium, but not one which can give your phone the much better protection on falls. So you'll have to spend an extra 1k or 1.5k for a one plus made case.Device Review conclusion is that this is the best phone in categories like:1) Performance - Fastest Android device on earth now and speed tests with OP7Pro revealed that this set is slightly faster than 7 Pro because of the 60Hz display, and smaller screen size.2) Best value for money if you are one who bought the 128GB version, as there is UFS 3.O available and you can store your data to external drives or laptop.3) This phone is jack of all trades and master of few if not all things.4) Battery endurance5) Top Display for typical use and gaming.6) Uses one of the best camera sensors from Sony that's the Sony IMX 586.7) Night photography with Nightscape 2.O. is one of the best in business right now.8) UI is superb.10) Customer care support is 24x711) Cutomizations are premium.12) Practical buy than it's elder brother Pro. This handset maintained the tagline Flagship Killer with it's pricing and features adopted from 7Pro.Things you'll miss out from One Plus 7Pro -1) An ultrawide angle lens which we don't use in 90% of photography.2) A 90Hz refresh rate, which is amazing but drains your battery by one third.3) A bazeless display given that the Pro uses a motorized pop up camera. But 7 uses a camera notch which is quicker than 7Pro in terms of face unlock and saves a bit on battery.4) A 300 mah more on battery, but endurance wise not better than 7. Also it adds to the weight of the phone as 7Pro weighs 200+ grams and 7 weighs 180+5) Curved edges and Horizon notification lightning is available in 7Pro which we miss on 7.6) The upper speaker grill is quality plastic on 7 and metallic on 7Pro. Not an issue.7) Sim Tray is plastic in 7 but metallic in 7Pro. Not an issue.8) You'll get a slightly bigger screen on 7Pro. But I don't appreciate too big screen sizes. So happy with this one personally.9) You'll be getting a 20w dash charger with 7 and 30w warp charger for 7Pro. But after 50% dash charging speed beats the speed of warp charger and finish the job in a better rate compared to warp.10) You'll get a Matte finish variant in 7Pro which you won't get in 7.11) In 7Pro there is no camera bump protruding as much on 7.Camera Review:Potrait mode in daylight - Stock Camera brings the best bokeh effect and natural colors. While the GCam color tends to be warmer and bokeh effect is missed in most cases.Normal Camera Mode - The Stock Camera brings natural colors and better exposure but GCam beats in better dynamic range, better details. But GCam lags by having a warmer tone and poor exposure.Selfies in Potrait and Normal mode - GCam gives more of a natural color in artificial lighting conditions than Stock Camera but it is beaten by Stock Camera in outdoor conditions. Always use the Bokeh effect in GCam or Stock cam for selfies as it brings out the best picture.Nightscape 2.O is an absolute killer in extreme dark conditions, where GCam struggled to pull out details. But in moderate lightning conditions use the GCam as it brings a more natural color tone, more natural edges, and more details with better exposure. Also in normal night photography, Nightscape 2.O brings better exposure and better lighting but struggles when it comes to natural edges, and natural details.To conclude, the device has a camera hardware which is extremely good and the comparison tests revealed the same. A few software updates can solve the existing cons given what you have on table right now. For the meantime it's the preference of the user whether he can sacrifice few things between using GCam and Stock Camera app."
2,Jitendra Kumar,5,The Saviour of the Brand,"The Saviour of the BrandIt is a known fact that many people are disappointed with OnePlus 7 Pro's pricing, size, thickness, bulkiness, bugs like phantom touches, etc. At least me, being a OnePlus fan from past so many years, was very much disappointed with OnePlus 7 Pro, in every aspect.But however, this OnePlus 7 completely restores back the lost glories of the OnePlus history. This is my opinion. Now let us dive into the Pros & Cons of this amazing device, OnePlus 7:Pros:1) Display: I use both Samsung and OnePlus devices. The reason is: I love Samsung's vibrant AMOLED displays and OnePlus device's fantastic, butter-smooth, fastest Oxygen UI. So I always desired both on one phone (display and fastest Oxygen UI). And at last, OnePlus 7 fulfilled my desire. OnePlus 7 has a fantastic UI (Oxygen OS) + display like Samsung devices (like S10+). But note that this will NOT BE BY DEFAULT. By default on this OnePlus 7, the display is not great like Samsung AMOLED displays. To achieve Samsung S10+ display on this OnePlus 7 device, you have to do this: go to Settings --> Display --> Screen Calibration --> Advanced and select AMOLED Wide Gamut. Then see the magic. It matches exactly with Samsung S10+. This option is NOT there on previous OnePlus devices (not there even on 6T). So OP7 gets 5 stars for the display.2) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855 chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. Nothing more to comment. So OP7 gets 5 stars for its powerful processor.3) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. So OP7 too gets 5 stars for its Oxygen UI.4) Camera: I am very much astonished to see the powerful 48 MP camera on this OnePlus 7 device. I have attached a few pictures. Please have a look.5) Battery: Though battery backup will be great on all OnePlus devices, on this particular model I felt battery backup little more powerful compared to older devices. I think this is due to the latest Oxygen version, which has been fine-tuned still more for battery efficiency.6) Storage: Whenever I buy the smartphones, I transfer my huge number of Lord Krishna's bhajans, wallpapers, videos, etc. So since this time I had opted for 256 GB, I was not selective while copying the files. I just copied all my 177 GB data to my new OnePlus 7. And believe it or not, everything just copied by the time I finished my short snacks break. Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage method. So OP7 gets 5 stars for storage too.7) Sound: Except on OnePlus 6, most of the OnePlus users enjoyed the LOUD sound. But on this OnePlus 7 device, along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect, which cannot be revealed in this writing, but only by hearing. So really excellent work they have done on this OnePlus 7 device in speakers segment too. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars in this sound segment too.8) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 6 GB this time also. In addition, we have RAM Boost feature also this time on OnePlus 7 series. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars for its fantastic low-power consuming RAM.9) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection. 5 stars.10) Dash Charger: The master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology (excluding Warp charger from the game). 5 stars.11) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth in this new 7 series. Really you love to slide simply. 5 stars.12) Fingerprint sensor: I can say that this is the world's first successful fastest in-display fingerprint scanner. However, I always prefer dedicated hardware fingerprint scanner. Just see OnePlus 6! Even today it is awesome. Anyways. 5 stars.13) Brightness: OnePlus has learned a lesson from its previous failures due to very, very low brightness levels on the screen. Earlier one has to keep brightness level at 80% for normal view. Many customers sold off their devices due to this mistake alone (I have seen in their forums). But fortunately, on this 7 series, the brightness level is good. One has to just keep at 30% to 40% for a good view.14) Vibration Motor: If you all remember, many users suffered from the worst quality vibration motors on a few previous devices, by hearing an abnormal rattling sound. But this time, as they promised, 200% strong we can feel. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity.Cons:This I want to be seen by OnePlus.1) Build Quality: People love even today the classic designs & metal bodies of previous OnePlus devices like 3, 3T, 5, 5T, etc. But this OnePlus 7 looks like plastic back (you can tap and test), although they call a glass body. I don't know what is the use of providing shiny glass bodies when, after all, it doesn't support wireless charging. They should have gone for the metal body, or at least, matte finished glasses like OnePlus 6 Silk White or Matte Black. It doesn't look anymore premium. Forget premium, it doesn't look good at all.2) Color Options: As said above, already the device is too shiny and fingerprint magnet. Along with that, the worst color options we have. I really don't know how many people like the Red color. Though colors are subjective, I don't think at least Red color is for professionals. And only one left option, shiny Mirror Grey. This too not for professionals. Really disappointing by seeing the color options we have. Why not give White & Gold options? OnePlus, it doesn't cost you extra.3) Size, weight, and thickness: I don't know why OnePlus is increasing dimensions, weight, and thickness of the device while Samsung is maintaining all these three in all the segments (budget to premium).Oneplus 5: 7.3 mm & 153 gramsOnePlus 5T: 7.3 mm & 162 gramsOnePlus 6: 7.8 mm & 177 gramsOnePlus 6T: 8.2 mm & 185 grams.And OnePlus 7: 8.2 mm & 182 grams + noticeably a huge ugly camera bump. One may argue that battery capacity is being increased. But just see Samsung. Let us consider even S10+. It is just 7.8 mm and 175 grams with 4000 mAH battery (whereas OP's max. is 3700 mAH battery). I am NOT satisfied with this.I think OnePlus should implement Samsung's wonderful thought of introducing small (S10e), medium (S10) & big (S10+) when they have started entering in series mode. But this device is bigger and heavier than S10+. If you are size-minded or too much worried about bulkiness, this is not for you (forget about OnePlus 7 Pro...my god, 8.8 mm with 205 grams).4) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: Today almost all the companies have started to provide pop-up cameras even for budget phones and the biggest advantage of this is - full-screen display. Whereas this is NOT THERE on this OnePlus 7. Very sad. They could have charged little more for this and provided Pop-up Selfie Camera (just like in 7 Pro). I really think this is a big con in today's technology.5) Screen Guard: I saw a few people complaining protective film on OnePlus 7 Pro had bubbles and not applied properly. I think this is the case on this OnePlus 7 too. Because on my device also (although flat surface) have two air bubbles on the protective film. First time I am seeing this on OnePlus."
3,OneStepUp,5,Felt more of a lateral move than vertical. Good phone overall but has its own shortcomings,"I have been a loyal OP user for many years now. And i recently upgrade from OnePlus 6 to the 7. My review is from the perspective of a loyal OP user who is now a bit sceptical about the brand & how long will my loyalties withstand. Please do not get me wrong - I did give the phone 5 stars & I shall explain why my last statement is contrary to my rating.First up - OP knocked the pricing out of the park with the OP7. I previously owned a OP6 8/128 gb version & I have been wanting to upgrade to 256gb since I use my phone extensively for taking photos & watching movies on the go.The UFS 3.0 storage helps a lot with that. More over the 3700mah battery (from 6T) helps power through the day with ease. Certainly better than the 3300mah on the OP6.Secondly, the speaker quality feels great. I can finally hear the phone ring in my pocket or in the other room. Something the 6 struggled with. The larger earpiece is also great for calls finally. The rather tiny earpiece on the OP6 made it tough to keep It in position to hear the other person while you are walking. I often found myself cranking the volume all the way to max on the OP6. However on the OP7, I dial it down to 20-40% and yet its loud for my ears.Thirdly, the button placement is much better - especially the alert slider which is finally more ergonomic. Fit and finish is great as usual - as we have come to expect from OnePlus over the years.Fourthly, the value for money is excellent on the OP7. In line with my first point. I recall paying 38k for the 8/128gb OP6 last year. And this year for 36k, I got 8/256gb OP7.Lastly, after my OP6 trade-in and SBI discounts etc, I got the OP7 for 17k - which in my opinion is an excellent deal.The obvious question is : why not the OP7 Pro? The Pro is the uber cool phone which everyone has been raving about. Here are my reasons:I prefer the smaller footprint & size. Makes it easier to use single-handedly. Although a 6.4inch phone is not even close to ergonomically,  And I personally found the weight distribution on OP7 to be far better than the Pro model. 200+ grams on the Pro is just out of my daily usage comfort zone.The price - for 15k more, the incremental benefits was simply not worth it - for me. But I see a lot of people seeing excellent value for it might as well be worth the extra spend for many users.I prefer not having any physical moving parts on my handheld devices. And no I do not find the pop-up camera concept. As a matter of fact, I might have considered the Pro had it been a hole-punch instead. The pop-up camera was the biggest reason why I decided to get the OP7 instead.While the quad-HD screen & 90hz screen sounds futuristic - I am a simply guy & I prefer simplicity. A 60hz 400+ppi display is all you need for everyday usage. And I prefer the longer battery backup any day. Besides content for 90hz is limited making it just a gimmick. I have seen a few friend who got the Pro and bumped the resolution down to 1080p from quad-HD just to conserve battery. I find it funny. Like - they paid for the feature & don’t use it.Moving on to the last part - as to why I think that I find myself a bit skeptical OP7 & my brand loyalties feel shaky.To be honest - there is no big innovation I see coming from OP at this moment. OP seems to be falling into the trap that Apple did over years. Between the OP6, 6T & 7 - there is little to no change besides the internals (the processor & may be memory speed). If anything - they have constantly dropped features which will always be a sore point for a brand loyalist. First the 3.5mm jack was dropped in 6T but there was some saving grace with the type-c to 3.5 adaptor in the box. With the OP7, they took that adaptor away as well - forcing you to either buy an adaptor or move to BT.The in-screen fingerprint reader is also a sore point. It just isn’t accurate. Especially, once a tempered screen guard is applied. This is a known fact about the 6T. But I miss the OP6 biometric which was way more accurate & quick. Even the ultrasonic sensor on the Samsung is way more reliable. The fingerprint reader on OP7 is disappointing to say the least - definitely a downgrade in my opinion from OP6.The screen & good at this price & suffices daily usage needs. I would have preferred a more brighter screen - than the 6T screen handed down to save costs.While the Sony IMX586 sensor is all the rave across all mid-range flagships these days, the image processing is lagging behind on OP. Ofcourse a few SW updates will probably fix that - and with a Google Camera app installed - it already improves the output by leaps & bounds. That said - the secondary camera is useless & I don’t know why OP decided to put that in. When Google can offer excellent Bokeh effect using a single lens & SW magic. Either a wide angle lens or Telephoto lens instead of the silly 5mp secondary cam would have been more useful. Even a macro mode Lens would have been a far better upgrade.Now I am not going to beat around the topics like no IP rating or Memory card etc - those are in the past & most people have moved on or rather accepted it.But there is no innovation to wow OP users & keep them engaged. I still prefer the simplicity, speed & the clean SW experience - probably the reason why I continue with OP. But is that enough in the long run to keep customers engaged.Overall the OP7 is a great phone & offers a snappy experience with a clean Android OS running the show for you. But I constantly find the wow factor missing from each newer generation release. I hope the next 7T or 8 changes my opinion & keep me glued to the brand."

There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity.Cons:This I want to be seen by OnePlus.1) Build Quality: People love even today the classic designs & metal bodies of previous OnePlus devices like 3, 3T, 5, 5T, etc. But this OnePlus 7 looks like plastic back (you can tap and test), although they call a glass body. I don't know what is the use of providing shiny glass bodies when, after all, it doesn't support wireless charging. They should have gone for the metal body, or at least, matte finished glasses like OnePlus 6 Silk White or Matte Black. It doesn't look anymore premium. Forget premium, it doesn't look good at all.2) Color Options: As said above, already the device is too shiny and fingerprint magnet. Along with that, the worst color options we have. I really don't know how many people like the Red color. Though colors are subjective, I don't think at least Red color is for professionals. And only one left option, shiny Mirror Grey. This too not for professionals. Really disappointing by seeing the color options we have. Why not give White & Gold options? OnePlus, it doesn't cost you extra.3) Size, weight, and thickness: I don't know why OnePlus is increasing dimensions, weight, and thickness of the device while Samsung is maintaining all these three in all the segments (budget to premium).Oneplus 5: 7.3 mm & 153 gramsOnePlus 5T: 7.3 mm & 162 gramsOnePlus 6: 7.8 mm & 177 gramsOnePlus 6T: 8.2 mm & 185 grams.And OnePlus 7: 8.2 mm & 182 grams + noticeably a huge ugly camera bump. One may argue that battery capacity is being increased. But just see Samsung. Let us consider even S10+. It is just 7.8 mm and 175 grams with 4000 mAH battery (whereas OP's max. is 3700 mAH battery). I am NOT satisfied with this.I think OnePlus should implement Samsung's wonderful thought of introducing small (S10e), medium (S10) & big (S10+) when they have started entering in series mode. But this device is bigger and heavier than S10+. If you are size-minded or too much worried about bulkiness, this is not for you (forget about OnePlus 7 Pro...my god, 8.8 mm with 205 grams).4) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: Today almost all the companies have started to provide pop-up cameras even for budget phones and the biggest advantage of this is - full-screen display. Whereas this is NOT THERE on this OnePlus 7. Very sad. They could have charged little more for this and provided Pop-up Selfie Camera (just like in 7 Pro). I really think this is a big con in today's technology.5) Screen Guard: I saw a few people complaining protective film on OnePlus 7 Pro had bubbles and not applied properly. I think this is the case on this OnePlus 7 too. Because on my device also (although flat surface) have two air bubbles on the protective film. First time I am seeing this on OnePlus.VERDICT:Although OnePlus 7 has a few Cons, while considering the PROS and PRICE, IT IS VERY MUCH WORTH BUYING and really deserves 5 stars. Though OnePlus 7 Pro disappointed many, I am sure this will NOT disappoint, because it is really worth FOR THE PRICE WHAT YOU PAY. So definitely this device has saved OnePlus I feel."

 Is One Plus 7 the ultimate flagship killer, maybe yes till August or 2019 end.Is it worth to buy One Plus 7 now, YES it’s a steal deal price for people who want pure performance, latest resource, and decent camera an affordable rate.Below is my observation on One Plus 7 compared to devices like One Plus 7, One Plus 7 PRO and Oppo Reno 10x which are priced very similar. I have bought this One Plus 7 and also booked the Oppo Reno 10x. Let’s see how One Plus 7 fares in the market competition.CAMERA - FRONT==============👍  16MP f/2.0 25mm wide - camera is very good not excellent though.👎🏻  No popup and is a water drop design on the displayCAMERA - BACK=============🆗  Dual camera setup, but secondary camera is only a depth sensor with 5MP. Cannot use this second camera separately.👍  Primary camera is 48MP Sony IMX586 sensor, with f/1.7 aperture, has Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), and PDAF.🆗  Slow-mo: 4K at 60fps, 1080p video at 240fps, 720p video at 480fps. Not the greatest but still not bad at all.👎🏻  No optical zoom telephoto or ulta wide angle camera>> Use 'Gcam' for better photo than the stock Camera app. It drastically improves the software post processing.DISPLAY=======👍  6.41” size, 19.5:9 ratio👍  Optic AMOLED👍  Full HD+ 1080x2340 ~402ppi👍  Refresh rate of 60Hz👎🏻  Water drop NotchBATTERY & CHARGING===================🆗  3700 mAh Li-Po batter, Lasts for 5 hours on-screen time on heavy usage with videos, gaming and mobile data with sync.🆗  Fast charging 20WPROTECTION===========👍  Corning Gorilla Glass 6 – Front👍   Corning Gorilla Glass 5 – Back🆗  No IP rating but is supposed to have a coating that is water resistant. Warranty not covered due to liquid damage.MODEM & NETWORK==================🆗  Has Cat16 1024/150Mbps modem, same as 6T👍  Has all Indian Bands covered with dual VoLTE. No direct Video calling available, might come back as update.PROCESSOR, GPU, STORAGE & RAM=============================👍  Qualcomm Snapdragon 855, 7nm chipset, Octa-core (1x2.84 GHz Kryo 485 & 3x2.42 GHz Kryo 485 & 4x1.8 GHz Kryo 485)👍  Adreno 640👍  128GB with the 6GB RAM variant and 256GB with the 8GB RAM variant with UFS 3.0👎🏻  No expandable storage – no SD card support but 128GB should be enough for mostANDROID VERSION, OS & BLOATWARE===============================👍  Oxygen OS 9 on top of Android 9.0 (Pie)👍  No bloatwareOTHER FEATURES===============👎🏻  No 3.5 mm headphone jack. Only type C earphones can be used. No earphones comes with the box👍  Support Dolby Atmos👍  Stereo Speakers🆗 No infrared remote, most phones except LG, Xiaomi don’t have👍  Type C version 3.1👍  Bluetooth version 5 with aptX HD, A2DB, LEOVERALL - WORTHY BUY========  :::::::::::::::::::::👌🏼   A great phone for pure performance in terms of Processing.👌🏼   Absolute buy for anyone who is looking to into Gaming, Multiprocessing and applications that requires large resources like video editing on the go.👉  Decent camera but not a great one for now, hope updates will improve. Use gcam for better photos. So if camera is your primary requirement along with SD855 processor go with Oppo Reno 10x which has triple camera and 10x hybrid zoom.👉  If display is the most important with SD855 processor go with One Plus 7 PRO.  Ø In my perspective I loved the curved 2K display of One Plus 7 but that 90Hz (can be reduced to 60Hz) and 2K display is draining the battery faster and on-screen time is less than 4 hrs for high usage. Ø Better than Oppo Reno SD710 model which is at the same price. The Oppo Reno 10x 8GB RAM variant seems to be a better option, BUT only when you pre-book it with the offers and exchange. With Pre-booking you can get additional discount of 5K+old phone price, 10% (min Rs.4500) HDFC instance discount bringing the phone down to around Rs.40000. At this price you can get a bigger battery, higher RAM and storage, great telephoto lens with 10x hybrid zoom, a good ulta-wide camera and the flagship Sony IMX586 48MP camera which a great post-picture software processing and a Ultra Night Mode 2.0 for low light photography which is next to Huawei P30 PRO, but you won't get UFS3.0 storage which is not a big deal. Ø With even more money to spend the Samsung S10 PLUS version would be very good option than One Plus 7 PRO or Oppo Reno10x. And with surplus money the Huawei P30 pro (but no android or Google app updates after 3 months due to US restrictions on Huawei) for ultimate camera performance.Certainly One Plus 7 will be the best selling product of the year and totally worth for the price, and thanks for Amazon for the quick delivery and getting exclusive. ❓   So is this the ultimate Flagship Killer? Maybe yes for now, but maybe not until Xiaomi’s Redmi K20 PRO releases by mid-July. But Xiaomi usually has a lot of bloatware and advertisements in app. We need to wait and see the comparison for the flagship killer awards. (Poco F2 that will be released soon will not use the SD855)."
6,Brendon Fernandes,5,Faster than light! (Update after one year),"As someone who's admired the OnePlus series of phones for ages, I've always dreamt of actually owning an OP7 device. And when the OnePlus series saw its first price did, I felt that a better time to purchase this phone would never come.PERFORMANCEFor starters, having moved from a Honor 7x, with its sub-par processor, let me tell you that the first thing you're going to notice, and probably gawk at, is how fast this phone is. The moment you close your first app in your app drawer, and see your OP7 seamlessly move from animation to animation, will you realise that the phone you've purchased is a purchase well made. The phone handles everything you throw at it, be it PUBG on HD +Ultra, Emulators, or even Fortnite without a scratch. And I'm saying this as someone who's using the base variant of the device.BATTERY LIFENot going to lie, I can't comment on the battery life since I've never really used the phone down to the wire, but the 3700 mAH battery will easily get you through the day.CHARGINGNow this is one of the many places where the phone shines. The OnePlus 7 will provide you the best charging speed out there. Just sleep on 10%, wake up on 5, and watch it charge to a 100% just as you are about to leave for work or college. The quick charging speeds probably make it pointless to really talk about battery life, since all you really need is to plug it in a charging port for 10 minutes or so to power it up incase you run out of battery.CAMERAWhile most tech junkies say that the OnePlus series always tends to have a lackluster camera, I think the camera is good enough to capture the moments you cherish. It's Nightscape mode performs extremely well during the night, and it's day time shots in natural light are pleasing to look at. Of course, phones like the Asus 6Z and the Pixel 3a have much better cameras in this segment, but the OnePlus 7 does what it needs to do.SCREENThe screen is immensely gorgeous to look at. The screen is probably better than anything the competition throws at it. If the screen is something that's important to you, stop waiting and order this phone right awaySPEAKERSThe stereo speakers on the phone do their job well. They play music really really loud, to the point where you don't even need to use external speakers to have a party started. The Dolby Atmos technology is what makes it even better, and if you're someone who consumes a lot of media without using any earphones, this phone is going to be a treat.Others: The fingerprint scanner works really fast even though the technology is relatively new. The face unlock is so fast that it actually gets annoying, since you sometimes want to check what's on your screen instead of unlocking your phone. The silicone case and the screen protector are really nice though there are quite a few scratches on the screen protector already. I would not recommend using this device without a cover or a screen protector as the device is completely made of glass and metal.OXYGEN OSOxygenOS takes the best of both worlds, the minimalism and simplicity of the stock Android, along with some really neat bells and whistles to enhance the overall user experience. The screen recorder, the Fnatic mode, and the ability to change the theme of your phone and its base color, etc. It's works fast, it's simple, and its probably the best.ComplaintsOf course, there is no such thing as a perfect phone. And while I've admittedly been enamored by this device from the moment I've had it in my hands, I do have complaints.1. Notch: If you're someone who cares about his screen real estate way too much, then this phone is probably not for you. While the notch can be hidden using quirks within the settings, just like the parable of the 99 coins, you'll definitely wish the notch wasn't there.2. Headphone Jack: If there's one thing that will annoy you about this phone, especially if you're someone who moved from a budget phone like me, the lack of the headphone jack will give you a headache. If you're someone who immensely cares about having this thing on their device, then it's best if you don't purchase this device. However, this is nothing but a minor complaint on my end.3. Lack of dongle/earphones in the box: I honestly wish OP supplied one of these with their phone. It would have been better than purchasing subpar dongles or earphones.Summary: To sum it up, the OP7 is a wonderful device. If you're someone who consumes media and plays games, you're not going to find a better device than the OP7 in this price range.Edit: It has been a year since I got this phone. I have found no issues with it and it works as it should. If there's one problem I've found, it's that the base of the phone gets quite hot if you play games on it for too long on HD/Ultra mode. Since I don't really play high demanding Mobile games, I have no issues with the device for this. I hope to use it for two more years."
7,Bhushan,5,Should you Buy OnePlus 7 or wait for Redmi K20 Pro.?,"Bought OnePlus 7 (8 GB variant) in first sale, using from more than 1 month, pretty impressed with OnePlus 7, sharing detail review:Display: 5/5Performance: 5/5Camera: 4/5Battery: 4/5Price: 5/51) DISPLAY: 6.4 inch AMOLED Full HD Plus display looks beautiful with waterdrop notch.

 I don't want to bore you with the back story of why I decided to buy this, and I'm not going to repeat the same specifications that you can see everywhere. I use both an iPhone & One Plus 7 everyday (iPhone for business & 1+7 for personal use). Here's how it performs in the real world:Part A - The Good:1. General Performance: Stock Android is known to be sluggish and often makes even simple tasks frustrating. What I love about One Plus is their customisation of the OxygenOS (a custom variant of Android). It is so refreshing to use it and everything works seamlessly. It takes a simplistic approach and makes the user feel comfortable.2. Camera: Too obvious, right? Forget the number of lenses, aperture, megapixels, etc. Just look at the sample images. This camera is one of the best in segment, and if you know the basics of photography, switch the cam to 'Pro Mode' to capture stunning photos! This phone is a boon for photography enthusiasts who do not want to invest on a DSLR, and want to learn the basics of photography by using a good phone camera.3. Build Quality: Quality of materials used, and enclosures made are really good and feels secure. Besides the screen, I wouldn't be worried if the phone falls. It's quite sturdy!4. Fingerprint scanner & Face Password: The on screen fingerprint reader is PERFECT! It ALWAYS works. And super-fast; less than 0.5s! I am in love with the on screen fingerprint reader. Moreover, you will barely need to use it anyway, if you use the Face unlocking feature. If you think the fingerprint reader was amazing, wait till you try the accuracy of the face password! It's again surprisingly accurate and never fails! If the lighting is low, it will turn up the screen brightness to spill light on your face and read it. So - it always works! Though I use an iPhone with fingerprint reader, I realised that this on screen Fingerprint reader is quicker than the iPhone.5. Ring/Vibrate/Silent Switch: The phone has a dedicated selector for the three modes, and being an iPhone user since a decade, this is a really under appreciated feature that most phones don't have!6. Battery: I get around 10~12 hours for my heavy usage for constant calls/messaging and video streaming. This is really good, and though the battery capacity is low, it gives optimum backup.7. Warp Charging: The charger provided supports warp charging, which enables you to go from say 20% to about 50% in around 10~15 minutes!8. Gaming: Hello, gamers. Yes, it will run PUBG with highest settings and not much frame drops. To people who play other games; if it's able to play PUBG on highest settings, you have your answer.Part B - The Average:1. Design: The design is nothing exceptional. I'm not saying this is something negative. It's just that there's nothing significantly good about the design. It's quite an average design and no problem in it, everything works as usual.2. Sound: It has stereo speakers (Dolby Digital tech), but nothing great about it. Stereo speakers are now common among mid range & high end phones, and also the quality is not extraordinary. It does its job and it's sufficient.3. Video: Though the camera helps take amazing photos, the video quality is quite average. The Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS) is not that great, and also the video quality is nothing to awe us.Part C - The Bad: 1. Camera Bump: We know that the camera is really good. But, the camera housing protrudes out from the back case quite a lot. This housing has both lenses, and also the flash. For people who use a good thick back case, this won't be a problem. For you folks who use a thin case, or no case, if you keep the phone down with its back facing down, you are bound to scratch the camera housing over time and this will be a problem! I would recommend using a thick case with this.2. No USB-C to 3.5mm converter: It's 2019 and people are accepting the fact that the 3.5mm audio jack is a thing of the past. Yes, we get it. However, several people, including I, have studio quality headphones that we might have to use in some cases. Or maybe we need to plug an aux cable for something. Since there is no 3.5mm jack, you have to make use of a USB-C to 3.5mm converter, which is NOT provided by One Plus! WHY! After paying around Rs. 30,000 for this phone, I don't know why they wouldn't include a simple cable that would've been worth a few hundred rupees. Trying to find a third party converter is a hassle, as they are of cheap quality. This was really frustrating. Anyway, for those of you who don't use 3.5mm equipments, you don't have to worry.Conclusion:  I am extremely happy with this phone, it's performance, the battery backup and the camera quality. For those of you who are looking for the best phone around the Rs. 30,000 mark, you don't have any other logical choice - go for this! This is an all rounder and will suit all your needs."
9,Abhik Banerjee,5,OnePlus 7 review! Real flagship killer!,"Having used this device (OnePlus 7, 6-128 Gb) for well over a month now, I am penning down my thoughts. It's quite long, appreciate your patience.I previously used Mi A2(4-64Gb) for 8 months before upgrading to OnePlus. One if the few things I observed straightaway is the performance! SD855 is insane in terms of raw performance over SD660. The Oxygen OS optimisation proves itself making me understand why my colleagues still happily use older OnePlus devices ( OnePlus 2 and 3). The device feels smooth on day to day usage and doesn't break a sweat at all. Another area where i saw improvement was in radio signals( cellular and WiFi reception). OnePlus can even stay connected to the WiFi when i am at a floor below the router. My MiA2 would constantly drop signals at same floor itself! The download speeds over 4G LTE is a huge updgrade, although can be attributed largely to SD855 with faster modems over SD660. Call quality is exceptional over both speaker and earpiece with no distortions.The display is gorgeous! Crisp, accurate colors plus various display modes help me tweak the display before I launch adobe Lightroom to edit the photos. A wide gamut of colors is supported. The camera is decent enough and is good for capturing landscpes, street photos and objects. I usually don't shoot images of people (portrait mode) so can't comment much on that. But the landscape shots are stellar in all lighting conditions. Addition of histogram in pro mode can help you yield the best details out of your subject even in low light! Addition to that, OIS on lens makes sure your shutter speed can go really low in low light to capture the best details. Long story short, camera is awesome ( for most parts) and gets to A++ levels if you know how to post process images after shooting sessions. The only limitation is lack of ultrawide or tele lens.The speakers ( stereo with Dolby Atmos) are really loud. They have this depth to music which can be experienced only with stereo setup. Another huge difference I observed coming from MiA2 is the audio output via Mivi Thunderbeats Bluetooth headset. The sound is much better and fuller even at comparable lower volumes on OnePlus. This might be because of Dolby atmos  kicking in. Both devices have aptx codec for Bluetooth but OnePlus sounds way better. Additionally, Ldac and aptx hd are also supported in OnePlus so audio output over premium bluetooth headphones should be great.Battery life is good enough for 1 day usage. I usually charge around 80-85% and let it drain to 20-25% before I plug it in. With calls over 1.5 hrs to 2 hrs, social media, surfing chrome and camera usage and editing in Lightroom and Snapseed, i usually get through the day with around 4 Hrs of SOT (~60% charge). If someone uses the device for watching videos, mileage of roughly 1hr SOT can be achieved per 10% of charge which is great! Standby drain should be minimized in my opinion. Draining 6% with WiFi, data and location services off with both SIMs enabled and one on VoLTE. With dash charge, it takes roughly 30 minutes to charge from 20-25% till 85% ( max for me). I'm sorted for the day on most occasions!The in-display fingerprint scanner is blazing fast and accurate! Takes some time to get hang of it, but trust me its impressive! Make sure to register your fingerprint in dark to get better results and always re-register if screen guards are replaced.I haven't played games on this, but SD855 can run all the titles at max fps with ease. Few videos which i have watched on youtube mention that even at heavy CPU-GPU loads, there's minimum throttling compared to competition, resulting in smoother gameplay/ rendering even after stressed conditions on the device. Constant maximum frame rate can be achieved over longer gaming durations. This shows how greatly optimized Oxygen OS is. The device is already running August security patch and is sure to get another 2/3 android version upgrades and that's reassuring!The storage speeds with UFS 3.0 should be great when transferring data on/from computer. Haven't tested this, but i feel this storage spec should matter down the line when apps get heavier and the hardware starts to age. I have a strong feeling that OnePlus device will easily last for 3 years with good care and can even last beyond with a battery replacement in between!Thanks for being with the review till the end!"
